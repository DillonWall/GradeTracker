# GradeTracker

## Overview
This program is a grade tracking system that allows students to track their own grades with weighted assignment categories.

The aim of this application is to help students take calculating their current and projected grades into their own hands, 
eliminating the problem of waiting for teachers that don't update their online grading system.

Created in a group collaboration between Levi Leuthold, Dillon Wall, and Whitney Duarte in 2019.

## Installation
Open and run with Visual Studio 2022 (or your IDE of choice)

## Status
This project is mostly finished, but some features aren’t working properly due to the time/scope of the project. 

The following is a list that illustrates the missing features and how they should work:
* Course “0%” should display the overall percent grade of the course. 
* The trashcan icon only deletes the selected the course in the listbox not the course it’s next to.
* The add or edit assignment should have a dynamic drop-down box to change category.
